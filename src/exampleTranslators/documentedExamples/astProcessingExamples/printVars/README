EXAMPLE: printVars

This example demonstrates how to perform some simple operations on the
ROSE AST using class 'AstSimpleProcessing' and how to visualize the
AST using class 'AstDOTGeneration'.

To compile 'printVars' type
> make all

To display the computed values of a C++ file as input type
> printVars <filename>
A file called <filename>.dot is generated.
This is also executed as part of 'make check' using the file testInput1.C

To visualize the AST for the example file 'testInput1.C' type
> dot -Tps testInput1.C.dot > testInput1.ps
> gv testInput1.ps
