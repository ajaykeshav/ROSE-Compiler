// A native test case: a variable is assigned more than once in one execution path
// first assigned during declaration, later assigned again. 
//  x1 is assigned twice before the for loop, not a match!
//  testing if rajaChecker can ensure two conditions 
//   1. if at least one reaching definitions for a variable (x1) has a form of base+offset
//   2. all reaching definitions are the only one in a control flow path (previous DEF node of the reaching definition is a declaration or none)
// 
//  Update 11/3/2017. User codes do have a pattern like x1=x, x1=x. So I relaxed the analysis to allow this exception
