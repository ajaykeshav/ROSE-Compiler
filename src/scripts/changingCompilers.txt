We test ROSE with many different versions of compilers.
These are setup automatically from the crontab configurations,
but have to be setup manually for testing.  The trick to do this
is to run two commands:

  1) Run the compiler specific setup.chs or setup.sh script
     (e.g. "source /usr/apps/gcc/4.3.3/setup.csh")

  2) Then run:
        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/dquinlan/local/boost_1_37_0_installTree-gxx-4.3.3/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     for the specific compiler version required.
