# This script tags a particular release.  
# You give a revision number or date, and it builds a new tag.  
# e.g.
# Tag revision 725
#   ./tag-svn-version 725
# Tag the revision at 2008 June 11th, 6:00am Zulu time(2008 June 10th, 11:00pm Pacific time)
#   ./tag-svn-version 2008-06-11T06:00:00Z
# Do not run the script more than once per minute, or strange things will happen.
