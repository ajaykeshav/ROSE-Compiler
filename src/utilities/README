* Visualization  used in the documentation generation

lsviz : visualizes a directory structure as a graph (by using dot) and
        generates files in various formats like postscript, gif, jpeg, etc.
        It translates the output of ls to a dot tree description and 
        invokes dot. Several parameters allow to restrict and customize the
        output.
