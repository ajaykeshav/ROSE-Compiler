This directory hierarchy contains functional smoke tests.

=== Definitions ===

"Functional tests" are larger than a unit tests, but still more
focused than something like compiling an entire application.  Example:
a functional test might check that a proper control flow graph can be
constructed and traversed.

"Smoke tests" are the minimal set of small, fast, simple tests run by
end users via "make check" to test that ROSE basically functions. All
smoke tests _together_ should take no more than a couple minutes on
average hardware.
