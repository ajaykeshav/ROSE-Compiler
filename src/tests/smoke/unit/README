This directory hierarchy contains unit smoke tests.

=== Definitions ===

"Unit tests" have the following characteristics:
   * Test a single interface (API or private interface)
   * Use only interfaces that are previously tested
   * Run entirely in memory (no I/O)
   * Are single threaded (except for those whose sole purpose is to test thread APIs)
   * Are fast

"Smoke tests" are the minimal set of small, fast, simple tests run by
end users via "make check" to test that ROSE basically functions. All
smoke tests _together_ should take no more than a couple minutes on
average hardware.
