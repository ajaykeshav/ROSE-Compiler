This directory hierarchy contains unit nonsmoke tests.

=== Definitions ===

"Unit tests" have the following characteristics:
   * Test a single interface (API or private interface)
   * Use only interfaces that are previously tested
   * Run entirely in memory (no I/O)
   * Are single threaded (except for those whose sole purpose is to test thread APIs)
   * Are fast
