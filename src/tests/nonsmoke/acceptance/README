This directory hierarchy contains acceptance tests.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS ARE ALMOST CERTAINLY NON-SMOKE TESTS.

=== Definitions ===

Compared to unit tests or functional tests, acceptance tests tend to be:
  * Larger in terms of what they test (more APIs tested at one time)
  * More I/O intensive (processing large specimens, perhaps whole applications)
  * More memory intensive (might use a few gigabytes of RAM)
  * More CPU intensive (might take many minutes per test)

"Non-smoke tests" are anything but smoke tests. ("Smoke tests" are the
minimal set of small, fast, simple tests run by end users via "make
check" to test that ROSE basically functions. All smoke tests
_together_ should take no more than a couple minutes on average
hardware.)
