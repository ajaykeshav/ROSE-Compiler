# ROSE test harness configuration for LoopProcessor. See $ROSE/scripts/rth_run.pl --help

# Each test needs to run in its own directory when running in parallel because the test depends on the rose_* output
# file where "*" is the base name of the ${INPUT} file.  Some of the tests use the same input file and therefore produce
# conflicting output files.  We need to copy the input and answer into the work directory because they might have relative
# names.
