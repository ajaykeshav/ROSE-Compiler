Self contrained reference input and output files to show expected results for outlining using dlopen().
The goal is to test copy&paste the entire original source file file A to file B then append outlined functions to the end of file B. 

The original file is
* ./tests/nonsmoke/functional/roseTests/astOutliningTests/jacobi.c

rose_jacobi.c will use dlopen() to call three outlined functions (from three loops) stored inside jacobi_with_OUT.c.

Some more testing are in projects/autoTuning  

Put all outlined functions into a single separated file (1 shared library storing 3 outlined functions). 
* autotuning_lib.c   // dlopen helper functions
* autotuning_lib.h   // helper function prototypes
* rose_jacobi_lib.c   // the library file with both original input file content + outlined functions.
* makefile            
* readme  
* rose_jacobi.c       // the transformed input file with dlopen to use functions in the library file
* uthash.h            // a C hash function utitility 


To test this program, type 
  make check

To cleanup, type 
  make clean
