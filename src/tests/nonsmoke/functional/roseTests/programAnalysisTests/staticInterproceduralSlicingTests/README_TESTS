These tests demonstrate the slicing and the generation and use of the System Dependence
Graph.

test1.C works fine and is a simple demonstration.

test2.C demonstrates a bug when the printf() function is marked as a slice target
    (we have fixed this in the input code by makring the use of the variable "i"
     by marking "i;" instead.  Then it all appears to work fine.

Problems:
   1) The function arguments to a function call marked as a target slice are not marked.
      

   2) Quotes around literals need to be escaped in the dot output to avoid generation of 
      qhost nodes in the visualization of the dependence graphs.
