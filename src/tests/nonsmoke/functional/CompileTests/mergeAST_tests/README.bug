DQ (11/6/2016): There is a bug that is unique to the mergeAST_tests 
regression tests.  The problm is a memory error caused by some 
error in the way that some IR nodes (likely SgStringType) are
deleted within the mergeAST mechanism.

The temporary fix is to no call SgStringVal::get_type() function after 
the astMerge.  So this is suppressed where it occurse in the AST consistancy 
tests (see the TestExpressionTypes::visit() function in ASTConsistancyTests.C).

The problem can be demonstrated by setting the memory pool size to "1"
and using the Address Sanitizer (see ROSE configure options).

At a later date this will bug can be persued more agressively, currently
we want to see if this fix will work and provide consistant results on
all machines used in testing ROSE.  It might be that the bug is more complex,
than the fix provided will support.  We will see!
