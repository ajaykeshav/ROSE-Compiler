README for ROSE/TESTS/C++Code:

   This directory contains tests that are used to verify correctness of
the internal ROSE infrastructure.  Most tests were previous bug which have 
been fixed.


What is curently tested:
   All tests are run with -rose:tests 6 (level 6 tests) to test only the
ability to read the the file, transform to the internal AST format,
unparse to output a C++ code, and compile the resulitn g C++ output.

What is not tested:
   No transformations are done in these tests, and the internal AST (essentially 
the SAGE representation) is NOT parsed using the higher level grammars.  These
test would currently fail because of unimplemented features of the array grammars.
