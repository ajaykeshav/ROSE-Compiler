// This is a C example code and is not legal code in C++.

// This function needs additional support in ROSE to
// hold the variable "N" and the array "int a[N]" 
// We will add this later in the form of a scope
// for function prototypes.  This design will have
// a number of advantages over the current design
// (supporting this sort of code as an example).
