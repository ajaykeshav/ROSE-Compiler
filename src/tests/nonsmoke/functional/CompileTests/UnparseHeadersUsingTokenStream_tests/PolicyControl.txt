# Control file for ROSE policies

# This file tests the use of ROSE token based unparsing using inputs containing
# windows style line ending (thus it will fail the UnixLineTermination policy 
# that we generally enforce within ROSE).  However, it is not clear to me why
# if passes, so I need to look into this with Robb.
