This directory hierarchy contains shared specimens for non-smoke
tests. This hierarchy should NOT contain checkers or tests.

=== Definitions ===

A "Specimen" is some kind of input for a "checker". The input could be
source code, binaries, tables, config files, etc.  This directory
contains mainly specimens that serve as inputs for more than one
checker found in multiple other directories.

"Non-smoke tests" are anything but smoke tests. ("Smoke tests" are the
minimal set of small, fast, simple tests run by end users via "make
check" to test that ROSE basically functions. All smoke tests
_together_ should take no more than a couple minutes on average
hardware.)

A "checker" is a shell script or compiled program that reads a
specimen. A "test" is a makefile target that runs a particular checker
with a particular specimen to verify some ROSE capability.

=== Additionally ===

Each directory should contain a make include file named
"Specimens.inc" that defines variables that contain lists of specimen
names.  All such variables for a particular directory should have a
common prefix to prevent conflicts with similar variables in other
directories.
