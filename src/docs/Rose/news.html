        With the permission of the NSF Middleware Initiative (NMI) at University of
        Wisconson at Madison, ROSE uses a build and compile farm to support external nightly tests. The
        link on the left menu is to the nightly test results (an elaborate web page).
        Most tests pass, some tests fail (mostly on older platforms). Our goal is to be as transparent
        as possible in the representation of robustness and portability of ROSE on a daily
        basis. For more information about how we use NMI please refer to the chapter named 
        "Testing on the NMI Build and Test Farm" in
        <a href="ROSE_DeveloperInstructions.pdf">the ROSE Developer's Guide</a>
        for details about how we use NMI. We especially appreciate the work done
        by the NMI support team and their roll in helping to make ROSE more robust and
        portable over the last months.

        <p align="center"> <font size="4" color="#ff0000">Haskell bindings have been released.</font> </p>
        ROSE now includes language bindings for the functional programming language <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.  The bindings allow users to access and traverse ROSE's intermediate representation (IR) from Haskell in a type-safe manner.  Please refer to the chapter named "The Haskell Interface" in <a href="ROSE_Tutorial/ROSE-Tutorial.pdf">the ROSE tutorial</a> as well as the <a href="ROSE_HaskellAPI/index.html">API documentation</a> for details about how to use this new feature.

        <p align="center"> <font size="4" color="#ff0000">OpenMP 3.0 implementation has been released.</font> </p>
        An initial OpenMP 3.0 implementation using ROSE has been released. ROSE now can parse OpenMP 3.0 directives and translate OpenMP programs into multithreaded code targeting the GCC GOMP runtime library. Please refer to the Chapter named "OpenMP support" in <a href="http://www.rosecompiler.org/ROSE_UserManual/ROSE-UserManual.pdf">the ROSE manual</a> for details about how to use this new feature.

        A draft tutorial of a ROSE-based end-to-end empirical tuning system has been made available online. ROSE is a central component in the SciDAC PERI project to enable performance portability of DOE applications through an empirical optimization system, which incorporates a set of external tools interacting with ROSE to support the entire life-cycle of automated empirical optimization of large scale applications. Please goto <a href="projects.html" target="_blank">Internal ROSE Projects</a> to learn more about the project and download the draft tutorial.
