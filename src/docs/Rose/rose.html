        <p>ROSE is an open source compiler infrastructure to build source-to-source program 
        transformation and analysis tools for large-scale Fortran 77/95/2003, C, C++, OpenMP, 
        and UPC applications.  The intended users of ROSE could be either experienced compiler 
        researchers or library and tool developers who may have minimal compiler experience. 
        ROSE is particularly well suited for building custom tools for static analysis, program
        optimization, arbitrary program transformation, domain-specific optimizations, complex
        loop optimizations, performance analysis, and cyber-security.</p>

        <p>Like other compiler infrastructures, ROSE consists of front-ends, a midend, 
        and backends, but ROSE backends generate (unparse) source code. Thus ROSE is a source-to-source 
        compiler infrastructure.  The intermediate representation (IR) used in ROSE is high 
        level to build an abstract syntax tree (AST) that is well suited to source-to-source 
        (so ROSE does not loose any information about the structure of the original source
        code). The midend contains an evolving set of analyzes and optimizations. The
        Edison Design Group (EDG) front-end is used to parse C and C++ applications. Although the EDG 
        source code and interfaces are protected, they may be distributed freely in binary 
        form. Language support for Fortran 2003 and earlier versions (including Fortran 90/95,
        F77, F66, and Fortran 4) is based on the Open Fortran Parser (OFP) developed at Los Alamos 
        National Laboratory. ROSE converts the intermediate representations (IRs) produced by
        the front-ends into abstract syntax trees.</p>

        The Sage III IR used by ROSE is an intuitive,
        object-oriented IR with several levels of interfaces for building source-to-source 
        translators. All information in the original application is carefully preserved in
        its ROSE AST, including C preprocessor control structure, source comments, source
        position information, and template information (e.g., template arguments). Generic
        and custom program analysis and optimization tools can be built on top of the AST
        or any of the other graphs generated internally within ROSE. The ROSE unparsers
        generate source code in the original
        source languages from the optimized AST, with all original comments and C preprocessor
        control structures preserved. Finally, vendor compilers are used to compile the 
        optimized source code into executables for different platforms. ROSE translators
        can completely replace the vendor compiler, while still using it for the
        compilation of the generated source code.</p>

        <p>A number of program analyzes and transformations have been developed for ROSE. 
        They are designed to be utilized by users via simple function calls to interfaces.
        The program analysis available include call graph analysis, control flow analysis,
        data flow analysis (live variables, def-use chain, reaching definition, alias 
        analysis, etc.), class hierarchy analysis, data dependence and system dependence
        analysis, and MPI communication pattern analysis. Representative program 
        optimizations and translations developed with ROSE are partial redundancy 
        elimination, constant folding, inlining, outlining (separating out a portion of 
        code as a function), OpenMP directive lowering, automatic parallelization and loop transformations (a loop 
        optimizer supporting aggressive loop optimizations such as fusion, fission, 
        interchange, unrolling, and blocking).</p>
  
        <p> ROSE is released under a BSD-style license and is portable to Linux and Mac OS X
        on IA-32 and x86-64 platforms. It has attracted more than three dozen user groups
        worldwide for various research, development, and education purposes. For example, 
        internal users at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are using it for optimizing
        data structure abstractions and components. External users from other national
        laboratories and universities have been using ROSE for code instrumentation,
        static analysis, formal rewrite systems, empirical tuning, MPI verification, etc. 
        It also is being used by five universities for teaching and seven companies to
        support the development of commercial products. We welcome both external users and
        potential collaborators to work with us.</p>
