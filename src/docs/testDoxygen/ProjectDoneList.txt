Work done for the upcoming 0.8.9a release:
   -# (DONE) SgConstructorInitializer for case of "int()" does not have a class declaration and
    as a result we have no way of identifying that it is int type vs. any other primative 
    type.  This was part of the use of SgDefaultType before a change suggested by
    Jeremiah.  A solution would be to have the SgConstructorInitializer store the type
    explicitly and obtain the class declaration from the type where it was actually a
    class declaration.
   -# (DONE) Add tutorial example showing how to find the #define directives.
   -# (DONE) relational operators in C return SgTypeInt while in C++ they return SgTypeBool.  
    Currently ROSE returns SgTypeBool for both C and C++.  We need to fix this for the 
    case of C.
   -# (DONE) Check for Valgrind issues!
   -# (DONE) Write up problem reported by Liao specific to why "class" does not work in a
    *.C program compiled using -rose:C_only mode.
   -# (DONE) get_type() for SgStatementExpression is not quite correct, it returns SgTypeVoid
    and should instead retrun the type of the last expressionStatement, if it exists,
    else return SgTypeVoid.  so re return the default all the time, with out investigating
    the last statement to sse if it should be used.
   -# (DONE) Fix which backend compiler is used by "-E" option when compiling with "-rose:C_only"
    (currently calls g++ regardless of if "-rose:C_only", and it should be calling "gcc".
   -# (DONE) Rose version option -rose:version fails too easily (requires filename to be
    specified!).
   -# (DONE) Add option to permit generated code to be marked with "#define ROSE_GENERATED_CODE"
    within the output code (requested by Yarden at IBM).
   -# (DONE) Verify that typeid() returns type "const std::type_info" class.
   -# Separate out use of dot (graphviz) so it is not required by users (requested by
      Yarden)
   -# (DONE) Add Jochen's AST File I/O modifications.
   -# (DONE) Fix "g++: g++-E: No such file or directory" error in 
    ROSE/tests/CompilerOptionTests/testCpreprocessorOption directory.
   -# (DONE) SgAsmStmt case not handled in sageInterface function as required by AstCopy
    mechanism.
   -# (DONE) ROSE currently generates a "-o <object-filename>.o" option and causes ROSE to
    fail if one is already explicitly specified (because then there are two and the 
    backend compiler generates an error).
   -# (DONE) OpenMP test codes fail when -rose:C_only is used in 
    ROSE/projects/OpenMP_Translator/tests/cvalidationsuite/Makefile.am
    (at least one file, "", also fails and has been placed into the C_tests directory; 
    we need to use more of these c codes as tests).
   -# (DONE) In projects/OpenMP_Translator/tests/developmentTests, two test code fail: 
    inputJacobi.c and inputOrphanedFor.c
   -# (DONE) Note that I removed the ROSE/projects/OpenMP_Translator/tests/epcc-c/arraybench.c
    because it had been removed by Liao from his tests and had some problems.
   -# (DONE) Build a boost specific tests directory (using examples from Markus)
   -# (DONE) All Sage IR destructors have their body commented out so that the AST File I/O tests
    will pass.  The AST File I/O tests clear the memory pools using the destructors and
    this is likely the mistake.  We might consider a function to reset all fields in the
    IR node (a functionality similar to this is already generated in the destructors
    generated by ROSETTA).  Fix was sent in by Jochen.
   -# (DONE) Add imaginary type: SgImaginaryType
   -# (DONE) fixup definition of __imag__ and __real__ in rose_edg_required_macros_and_functions.h file
   -# (DONE) Fix Markus's bug (case of template template parameters).
   -# (DONE) Add filename option to specify filename to accumulate compile-time performance 
    results (project with Gary Yuan).
   -# (DONE) Separate out tests in developersScratchSpace/Dan so that C++ codes are tested using
    menchanisms in ROSE for C where they have no C++ specific constructs.  Organize
    better testing for C and C++ (instead of C++ by default and sometime C).
   -# (DONE) Fix "Lookup of Sg_File_Info referencing targetFileName =
    rose_edg_macros_and_functions_required_for_gnu.h was unsuccessful"
    warning message for Intel compiler.
   -# (DONE) Remove use of "-DHAVE_CONFIG" everywhere, it is not required now.
   -# (DONE) Fix tutorial to include example of traversal using inherited and synthesized attributes.
   -# (DONE) Boyanna has reported that some of the paths in the install directory are absolute
    and that this is a problem when (I have to look up this detail).
    Note from Boyana: The easiest way to test is to rename the build tree top-level
    directory, then you'll get the relevant errors. We can't assume that the build is 
    available in general (usually it isn't), so it would be good if ROSE works with 
    just the installation location being available.
   -# (DONE) (Feedback from Peter Pirkelbauer: For the installation, it probably would make sense
    to add the edg-directory as library directory (LDFLAGS=-L\...),  in case that
    edg-binaries are used and the build directory is different from the source directory.
   -# (DONE) Clean up output in configure (still some debugging output from work with Intel
    compilers).
   -# (DONE) Add back the symbol table interface functions used by ANL (email from Beata).





   -# (DONE) Add Andreas call graph work (and his graph patch?)
   -# (DONE) Update Call graph work by Andreas (modification from March 28th version of ROSE).
   -# (DONE) Jochen's fixes that caused gnu 3.4.x and 4.x to break
   -# (DONE) AstAttribute interface into SgNode
   -# (DONE) Rich's SgInitializedName mangling support
   -# (DONE) Andrea's Wave work
   -# (DONE) Elsa Makefile magic for the "cc" directory, which appears 
      to be a problem name for a directory :-).
   -# (DONE) Separate out mangled name support from ROSE/src/ROSETTA/Grammar/Node.code
   -# (DONE) Add Rich's fix for mangling (latest minor patch)
   -# (DONE) New bug in testTauInstrumenter???




     - (DONE) Getting Started chapter in User Manual references MySQL, this should be changed to
       SQLite, since this is what we use now instead of MySQL.

     - (DONE) Shorten "Getting Started" Chapter  in ROSE User Manual.
         -# Update Requirements and Options 
         -# With what versions of compilers are supported
         -# Add reference to how to get the EDG Research License
         -# Update where to get ROSE documentation

     - (DONE) How to Build ROSE (section 2.3)
            -# Rewrite from point of view of distribution version.
            -# Move "Development" version specifics to different subsection.

     - (DONE) Optional Database Support (section 2.4)
            -#  Should be much shorter
            -#  Reference SQLite 
            -#  Reference example in ROSE Tutorial
 
     - (DONE) Generating documentation (section 2.5)
            -# There is NOW a "make docs" rule (correct in manual).
            -# Skip presentation of multiple modes of documentation
            -# This section is only relevant for developers.
            -# All documentation is distributed with the distributions.

     - (DONE) Building Translators using ROSE (section 2.6)
           -# This section should be shortened to just refer to the ROSE Tutorial.

     - (DONE) Move sections 2.7 through 2.9 to next chapter "Writing Your First Translator"
           -# Present a better (simpler) Makefile to support this.
           -# Rich is defining mechanism to avoid "#include<config.h>" in all the examples.
           -# Reference significant ROSE mechanism that are in the tutorial (in more
              detail): traversals, queries, PDF output, DOT output, rewrite mechanism.
           -# Put PDF example into ROSE Tutorial (since it will be removed from the ROSE
              User Manual)

     - (DONE) Submitting a Bug Report
              Say what to do with the bugs (send to Dan)
              Once we move the repository to ORNL we will 
              use automate bug tracking software.

     - (DONE) Design of ROSE (Chapter 3) is redundant and can be removed.

     - (DONE) Writing a Source-to-Source Translator (Chapter 4) is
         redundant with what is in the tutorial. It is a bit
         more complex than what we wanted in the proposed 
         "Writing Your First Translator" chapter as well.

     - (DONE) ROSE Examples (Chapter 11) remove this since it is redundant with the ROSE Tutorial.

     - (DONE) Remove Reference (Chapter 12)

     - (DONE) Remove Design and Implementation (Chapter 13)
          -# Move ROSE directory Structure graph to ROSE Overview

     - (DONE) Put some of the material in the current Appendix into a separate
         "Developer's Appendix".  Later this will likely become a separate
         Developer's Manual.

     - (DONE, added to Getting Started Chapter) Add section on what we mean by robustness of ROSE

     - (DONE, added to Getting Started Chapter) Add section on what compilers we use (for development) and 
       support (test), and what compilers we do not support (older versions of g++,
       specific architectures not ported yet, etc.).



        - (DONE) For chapters with lots of figures, LaTeX ends up sometimes putting
          figures in the following chapter(s), "far away" from their
          reference. Have you tried adding the LaTeX command, "\clearpage", at
          the end of each chapter? I'm not sure if it will work but it's
          supposed to: http://nwalsh.com/tex/texhelp/ltx-213.html
        - (DONE) Chap. 6 (AST Query), p. 30: Missing reference in "available within chapter ??"
        - (DONE) Chap. 7 (Traversals), p. 42: Figure is too large
        - (DONE) Chap. 8 (Database), p. 58: Figure too large
        - (DONE) Chap. 10 (Getting type info), p. 68: Figure of translator output is too large
        - (DONE) Chap. 29 (Global variable handling), p. 139: Chapter needs a more
          descriptive title, e.g., "Creating a 'struct' for global variables'
        - (DONE) Chap. 30 (TAU), p.147: I think the name, TAU, is usually written in all caps.
