# Instruction semantics tests are *very* sensitive to changes to the Disassembler and Partitioner classes
# because they and this test all use the instruction semantics. If the Disassembler or Partitioner is even slightly
# changed, it could make a different number of calls to the instruction semantics, which changes the sequence number
# used to generate variable names. Therefore, when comparing the test output with the expected answer, we will renumber
# all constant names sequentially.
#
# This renumbering causes values to change size, messing up things that are alinged in columns. The difference in spacing
# could be interpreted as significant, so we'll squash all horizontal white space down to a single character.
#
# These tests are still sensitive to minor formatting changes in unparseInstruction().
