KNOWN BUGS:

Issue 1: SgSwithStatement is visited in transfer function. Possible reason: init is wrong.

TODO:

1) annotating analysis results

  1.2) annotate case properly (currently post-info intentionally not
       attached because a comment attached to a SgCaseOptionStmt is
       not unparsed after the case label by the ROSE unparser, but
       instead after the associated stmt (which is wrong).

  1.3) annotate functions properly (currently body is annotated for
       entry/exit)

2) icfg print
  2.1) case label only (without stmt)

3) add output of AST labeling to analyterix as new option.

4) Labeler:
   associates the correct number of labels with all language constructs,
   but it also associates labels with all conditions (because they are
   SgExprStatements). getNode of this label should not return the stmt
   ifself, but instead the associated node. The exceptions are:
   if,while,do-while,switch.

5) the general rule should be: only nodes that are (directly)
represented in the ICFG are labeled. Example: number of labels for
if-stmt is 1. There should be two different access functions (now only
getNode): getLanguageConstructNode and getAssociatedNode.
The function getLanguageConstructNode would return the root node SgIfStatement,
whereas getAssociatedNode returns the node of the condition.
