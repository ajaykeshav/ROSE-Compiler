README -- ROSE/src/roseIndependentSupport/graphics

DQ (5/26/2007):  I don't think this is correct!
   We are revisiting this subject.  We might just
   want to use this in place of the Boost graphs
   and then provide mechanism to build a Boost graph 
   from this simpler graph when we require Boost graph
   functionality.

**********************************************************
   The files in this directory have been depricated!  ROSE
now uses Boost for generation of graphs and so these files 
are no longer required.
**********************************************************


This directory contains files to support the generation of 
graphs using techniques defined in the STL Components Book 
(chapter on Graphs).
