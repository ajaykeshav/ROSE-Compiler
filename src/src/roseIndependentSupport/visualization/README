README -- ROSE/src/roseIndependentSupport/visualization

DQ (5/26/2007): This work is old and a bit unfinished.
   We now use zgrviewer which is available as an open
   source project on the web and it works very well.
   zgrviewer replaced our need for this work, which 
   preceeded zgrviewer by several years.


These files implement the dotgl tool for the visualization of
large dot graphs.

Dependencies:
     FLTK     - Window Management Tool Kit
     X11      - General Windowing Package
     FreeType - vector font library
     GraphViz - Graph Vizualization Support (for DOT files) (version 1.10)
     OpenGL   - Graphics Library
     GLUT     - OpenGL Tool Kit


To compile on LLNL systems use configure options 
(had to install fresh versions of fltk and freeglut):
    --with-GraphViz_include=/usr/apps/graphviz/1.10/include/graphviz
    --with-GraphViz_libs=/usr/apps/graphviz/1.10/lib/graphviz
    --with-FLTK_include="/home/dquinlan/FLTK/fltk_install/include -I/home/dquinlan/FreeGlut/freeglut_install/include"
    --with-FLTK_libs="/home/dquinlan/FLTK/fltk_install/lib -L/home/dquinlan/FreeGlut/freeglut_install/lib"

After compiling dotgl:
  1) Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include graphviz,freeglut, and fltk
  2) Find a *.dot file and run "dot -Tdot test2004_21.c.dot > test2004_21.c.pdot"
     (any extension can be used, e.g. pdot)
  3) then run "dotgl test2004_21.c.pdot"



Things To Do:

    1) Setup GLUT_include and GLUT_libs configure options.

    2)
