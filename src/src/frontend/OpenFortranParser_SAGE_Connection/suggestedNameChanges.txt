The IR currently has some poorly selected names for the Fortran IR nodes.
Suggested changes are:
   SgProgramHeaderStatement -> SgProgramDeclaration

For functions there are:
   Program
   Procedure
   Function
   Subroutine

IR nodes should be:

SgFunctionDeclaration:
     SgProgramDeclaration
         This is just the declaration of the entry point for the program ("main").
         It has its own IR node in Fortran because it is a seperate language construct.

     SgProcedureDeclaration
          SgFunctionDeclaration
          SgSubroutineDeclaration
          These should be handled as a flag in the parent SgFunctionDeclaration.
          Note: subroutines return a void type and functions return a non-void type.


"SgFortranDo" should be changed to "SgDoStatement"
   In the do statement the "condition" should be changed to "bound"
