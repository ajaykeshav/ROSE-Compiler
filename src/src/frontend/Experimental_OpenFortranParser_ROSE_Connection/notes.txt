Notes on the new Fortran support

January 2016:
   1) Organization of remaining work.
      a. OFP (new version) currently handles free-form formated files
         and is tested on a NCAR CESM Fortran code. This code base includes POP.
         Available from: (get this from Craig)
         Registered at NCAR CESM site:

         We should include these codes into the ROSE regeression tests, but not released in ROSE.
      b. Craig will also add the ROSE fortran regression tests at some point.
      c. Get latest version of OFP into ROSE.
         The latest version of OFP generates Aterms in some fomat.
         OFP now included the unparsing of the Aterm representation back to Fortran code so that
         round trip testing is now possible.


December 2017:
   1) Coarray type support
        a. SgCAFCoExpression
        b. SgExprListExp coarraySpec = entityAttr.buildDimensionInfo()
            - entityAttr.setCodimExp
            - entityAttr.setHasCodimesion(true)
            - DeclAttributes
            - arrayType->set_dim_info(expressionList isa SgExprListExp)
   2) SgArrayType
       - set_index(SgExpression*)
       - set_dim_info(SgExprListExp*)
       - set_rank(int)  # should be size_t
       - set_is_variable_length_array(bool)
       - set_base_type(SgType*) 
   3) Experimental_General_Language_Support
