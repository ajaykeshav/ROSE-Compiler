Plans for the Untype IR node Design

1) Where SgUntypedStatementList is used we want to use SgUntypeStatementPrtList
   to absorb the SgUntypeStatementList IR node into its parent.

2) Craig has added some IR nodes that don't appear to represent parts of the grammar
   and the goal for the untyped IR id to represent specific elements of the grammar 
   (accross multiple languages).
