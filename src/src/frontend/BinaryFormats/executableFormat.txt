DQ (6/10/2008): 
These notes document how we want to connect the
classes defined in this directory with the IR nodes
that we need to build to represent the binary 
executable file format.


Design of existing data structures:

From ExecELF.h:
ElfFileHeader 
   ExecHeader (isa)
   ElfSectionTable (data member)
      ElfSectionTableEntry (container)
      ElfSection
         ElfSection (isa)
         ExecSegment (data member)

   ElfSegmentTable (data member)
      ExecSection (isa)
      ElfSegmentTableEntry (container)
         ExecSegment

ElfDynamicSegment
   ElfDynamicEntry (container)

% This is not yet used in any data structure (that I can see)
ElfSymbolSection
   ElfSymbol


From ExecGeneric.h:
ExecFile
   ExecSection (data member)
      ExecFile (data member)
      ExecSegment (container)
         ExecSection (data member)


From ExecPE.h:
DOSFileHeader

PEFileHeader
   ExecHeader (isa)
   RVASizePair (container)

ObjectTableEntry_disk

ObjectTableEntry

ObjectTable
   ExecSection (isa)
   ObjectTableEntry (container)

ImportDirectory_disk

ImportDirectory

ImportSegment
   ExecSegment (isa)
   ImportDirectory (container)



New IR nodes:
   ExecSegment
   ExecSection
   ExecHeader
   ExecFile


   ElfFileHeader 
   ElfSectionTable
   ElfSectionTableEntry
   ElfSection
   ElfSegmentTable
   ElfSegmentTableEntry
   ElfDynamicSegment
   ElfDynamicEntry

   ElfSymbolSection
   ElfSymbol

   DOSFileHeader
   PEFileHeader
   RVASizePair

   ObjectTableEntry_disk
   ObjectTableEntry
   ObjectTable
   ImportDirectory_disk
   ImportDirectory
   ImportSegment

Build these specific IR nodes so far:
   SgAsmGenericFormat
   SgAsmGenericSegment
   SgAsmGenericSection
   SgAsmGenericHeader
   SgAsmGenericFile
   SgAsmGenericSectionList
   SgAsmGenericSegmentList
   SgAsmGenericSupport


Questions:
1) Where is the raw file format?
2) Where is ElfSymbolSection used?


Ideas: 
   To make sure that we have absolutely everything, could we build
the function to reconstruct the binary executable from the representation
that we have?  And then test it to make sure it is identical.



(8/4/2008): Additional notes

1) In AsmElfSectionTableEntry.setDataPrototype("SgCharList","extra","= NULL",NO_CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMETER, BUILD_ACCESS_FUNCTIONS, NO_TRAVERSAL, NO_DELETE);
   the type is supposed to be "const unsigned char*", but this is a problem for ROSETTA to
   support. Both because it is "const" and because it is not clear if it is pointer to a
   unsigned char, an offset that only has to be 8 bits wide, or a C style string.
   Depending upon which of these is true we need to represent it differently.

   "extra" is intended to point to some uninterpretted bytes (i.e., a
   "hole") in the file.  These bytes can contain any value, including
   zero and values greater than 127. (RPM 8/14/2008)

2) For AsmElfSection.setDataPrototype("AsmElfSection*","linked_section","= NULL",NO_CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMETER, BUILD_ACCESS_FUNCTIONS, DEF_TRAVERSAL, NO_DELETE);
   We should likely be using an STL container, rather than a linked list here.

   An ELF section can point to one other optional associated
   section. This isn't a linked list but rather just a pointer to some
   other section. For instance, some sections that contain names
   (symbol tables, dynamic linking, etc) point to a string table where
   the names are stored. Nothing prevents multiple sections from
   sharing the same string table. (RPM 8/14/2008)

3) AsmElfSegmentTableEntry variable have a prefix of "p_" this is confusing to ROSETTA,
   since it reserves this for all data members as part of supporting the code generation.

4) Enum types need additional values: 
   a) "undefined = 0", if possible, and 
   b) "default = <nonzero value>"

   This provides seperate values for use by the destructor and default values to make it
   clear when values are uninitialized properly.

5) A lot of data members are public and don't have access functions, this complicates the
   move to support the new IR nodes.

6) I think that "sh_type" should be of type "Section_Type".

(8/13/2008): Additional comments after making initial release to Robb of his work using
             the new IR nodes.

1) SgAsmGenericFile currently contains two STL lists and it maybe should contain pointers to two
   IR nodes that contain STL list.  This is only true if the elements of the lists are 
   supposed to be children in the AST for the binary format.  the relevant data members
   are: "sections" and "headers".

   Currently there are no automatically generated access functions for these, but there
   are two access function manual implemented (one for each data member).


2) AsmGenericFile data member "data" is a "char*" type and should likely be an STL list 
   (SgUnsignedCharList).  

   FIXME

   "data" is intended to point to the entire executable file contents
   before (and while) the file is being parsed. We use mmap() rather
   than fread() throughout the parser for convenient, simple
   code. Both consider the data to be untyped (void*). However, we
   consistently treat the file as a stream of 8-bit bytes (unsigned
   char*). Furthermore, since the file is opened for read-only (mapped
   PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE) we also treat the buffer as constant (const
   unsigned char*). (RPM 8/14/2008)

3) (no longer applicable)

4) It might be that SgAsmExecutableFileFormat should be derived from SgAsmFile instead of
   SgAsmNode.  But upon reflection the file format is not an executable file it is the
   organization of the executable file.

5) IR nodes that are all derived from SgAsmExecutableFileFormat could be organized by
   executable file format (Generic, ELF, PE, NE, LE, DOS).  This would reduce the number of direved
   classed from 28 classes to 5 (Generic, ELF, PE, NE, LE).  This makes not essential 
   difference except to better organize the work and maybe provide a logical location for
   some of the binary executable file format specific details to live.


6) Removed SgAsmGenericSection::p_header data member.  Under the new IR nodes design it is
   redundant with the IR node parent pointer.  A "get_header()" member function was
   implemented to preserve the semantics of the original code, and is implemented using
   the parent pointer ("get_parent()").  The calls to the "set_header()" have been 
   fixed up in the code to call the set_parent() function; using the same input paremeter.
