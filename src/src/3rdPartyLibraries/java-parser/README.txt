This directory has the code for the Java parser and front-end support used in ROSE.
The most relevent part of this is the ECJ Java compiler, of which we use the frontend
and then provide a translation of the ECJ AST into that used by ROSE.

ecjROSE.jar:
   The jar file of the ECJ Java compiler which we use as a parser and frontend.
   The jar file can be extracted to the modified EDJ source cdoe used in ROSE.
   There are only a few trivial modifications, we have atempted to use ECJ as is
   to simplify how we can update the Java langauge support in ROSE. ECJ is 
   available on the web at: 
        http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/e/ecj/ecj_3.5.1.orig.tar.gz
   The Use of ECJ is made available under the Eclipse Public License.

JavaTraversal.java:
   The Java application which traverses the ECJ specific AST and makes the JNI calls
   which we implment in ROSE to support the translation of the ECJ AST to the ROSE AST.

JavaParser.java:
   This is the new home of the Java support, it is currently called by JavaTraversal
   but it will be called directly in the near future.  It implementat the support for
   the translation of the ECJ AST to the ROSE AST.

JavaParserSupport.java
   This file contains the static functions used to support the JavaParser work in ROSE.

ecjASTVisitor.java:
   This class is derived from the abstract class ASTVisitor in ECJ and all of it's
   methods are defined so that we can do the analysis (in Java) and cll the functions
   in JNI (implemented in C++) to construct the ROSE AST.  The implementation in C++
   of the JNI functions is located in the ROSE/src/frontend/ECJ_ROSE_Connection directory.

Makefile.am:
   The Automake/autoconf build system file.

CMakeLists.txt:
   This is the required CMake file to support the CMake build process.  CMake is
   used for Windows Visual C++ compilation of ROSE, but this has not been tested with the
   Java language support.

An undistributed directory is ECJ
   This contains the directory: org.eclipse.jdt.core. In org.eclipse.jdt.core, building
   the ecjROSE.jar file is done using "ant" (just type "ant" in the top level 
   org.eclipse.jdt.core directory.


Changes to ECJ:
   1) Note that the permsion of a class was changed to support the use of ECJ within ROSE.

   2) Note that the build.xml file was changed to uses javac 1.5, specifically:
				source="1.5"
				target="1.5"
      Note that this change might not be required now.




Modifier support for Java in ROSE:

   These are the modified required to be supported in ROSE for Java.

*abstract:     Should be supported in declaration modifier (already in type modifier for F90)
final:        Already supported in declaration modifier (used for PHP, but used similarly)
*native:       Part if JNI interface specification; should be part of function modifier.
private:      Already in access modifier.
protected:    Already in access modifier.
public:       Already in access modifier.
static:       Already in storage modifier
*synchronized: Should be added to function modifier
*transient:    Implies that the variable should not be serialized. Should be added to const-volatile modifier
volatile:     Already in const-volatile modifier
*strictfp:     Should be added to function modifier



My little TODO list (Dan):

   Types:
      Array types (e.g. String[] in test2011_02.java) is built as SgClassType, but not a SgArrayType of String).



   IR nodes to add for Philippe:
      SgForEach ( SgInitializedName or SgForInitStmt )
      SynchronizedStatement (SgExpression,SgBasicBlock)
      ThrowStatement  (Justified since it is part of the grammar)
   Make sure that ArithmeticException is found as a implicit type in Java

   The code representing cactionArgument() should be refactored so that
   it can be called to put arguments onto the stack (instead of processing
   them in the functions (and catch statement) when they are seen.
   The cactionArgument() was hijacked for use in the top down processing
   of method declarations and then commented out in the implementation from
   the Java visit() functions.
