/*! \class DominatorTree
  
  This class constructs either a dominator or a post-dominator tree
  for a given function. 

  First, let us define "Dominance." A node X in a CFG dominates node Y
  if all paths into Y must first pass through X. (Similarly, a node X
  post-dominates node Y if all paths out of Y must pass through X)

  To understand a dominator tree, first the concept of immediate
  dominance must be understood: For a given node Y in a CFG, its
  "Immediate Dominator" X is the nearest node which dominates Y. (For
  example, within straight-line code, the Immediate Dominator of any
  statement is the statement immediately preceding; in an
  if-statement, the immediate dominator of the first statement in the
  true-body is the conditional). The dominator tree is thus a graph
  where the successors for a given node X are all the nodes for which
  X is the immediate dominator.

  A post-dominator tree is similar except calculated using
  post-dominators (hence, an immediate post-dominator for node X is
  the first statement Y that must be executed after X).
