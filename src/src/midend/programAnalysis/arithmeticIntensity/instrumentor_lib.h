// Code Instrumentor library functions: __ci_ as prefix


/*
 *  Assumption:  the instrumentor tool has two execution modes: 
 *   1. count the total number of loops in an application, saving results like: 0 /path/to/firstloop:line:col
 *   2. using the results, instrument the loop with  __lc_counters[loop_index]++; and run the code
 *
 *   The execution of the code will write counters into a file like: 0 /path/to/firstloop:line:col 123 
 *   the 0th loop at location /path/to/firstloop:line:col, it has 123 iterations during the execution.
