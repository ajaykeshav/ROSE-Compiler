The prefix mechanism is an essential part of ther rewrite mechanism within ROSE.
It is however rather complex and must support numerous language features.

1) Directive Handling (Once the camel's nose in under the tent ...)
      We want to handle #include <filename> directives, but this cause many not so 
      obvious repercusions. One we support #include we have to support just about
      everything else, unfortunately.  The following example shows why:

      #if 0
      #include <x.h>
      #else
      #include <y.h>
      #endif

      If we skip the #if, #else, #endif processing; then we would get:

      #include <x.h>
      #include <y.h>

      which is clearly wrong.  Many variations on this are also possible.
      An option in the prefix generation permits the #include directives to be
      fully expanded.

2) A complicating detail in the prefix generation is the comment handling. 
   Since directives are seen as comments this applies generally to both comments and
   directives.  Comments appering before a function declaration are attached to the 
   function declaration, but comments appearing after the function declaration as the last
   comments in the file are attached to the SgBasicBlock (function body). I think 
   this asymetry is what adds to the complexity of the directive handling in the prefix 
   generation.

   I would propose that comments attached after a SgBasicBlock that are part of a 
   function definition which is part of a function declaration, we attached to the 
   function declaration directly.  Related asymetries exist whern comments are 
   attached after  SgBasicBlock that is part of a SgForStatement, etc.

   Asymetries to fix:
      SgBasicBlock
            with parent:
                SgFunctionDefinition
                     with parent:
                         SgFunctionDeclaration
                         SgMemberFunctionDeclaration
                SgForStatement
                SgWhileStatement
                SgDoWhileStatement
                SgIfStatement
