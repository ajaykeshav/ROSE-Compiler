I now think that this s not a problem, or not as much of a problem 
as I thought, since in code A, the "int x;" would not be traversed
and in code B, both the "int x;" and the for loop's body (SgBasicBlock)
would be traversed.

Problem in reverse traversal


From the case statement, it is not clear how to tell if the 
traversal is describing a traversal of code A or code B.

Code A:
     for (...)
        {
          int x;
        }

     switch(x)
        {
          case 1:
        }

Code B:
     for (...)
        {
          int x;
          switch(x)
             {
               case 1:
             }
        }



Problem:
The following code would not generate the correct prefix since the traversal
would not visit the "int x;" statement to collect the CPP directive that is 
attached to it.

Solution:
   Collect all comments and CPP directives from scopes which we pass on the 
way to the AST root during the reverse traversal.

Code C:

     for (...)
        {
#define PREFIX_CANNOT_FIND_ME
          int x;
        }

     for (...)
        {
#ifdef PREFIX_CANNOT_FIND_ME
          int y;
#endif
        }
