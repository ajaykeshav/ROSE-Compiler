This outlining has been modified to support outlining to a separate file.
This introduces the first case of an AST transformation that scatters
the AST across multiple files.  As a result we have discovered a number
of problems that need to be addressed:
  1) The definition of a proper AST is a file based concept since the 
     SgFile IR nodes for leaves of the SgProject root node.
  2) For the AST to be a proper tree (and be traversed as a tree)
     there can be no reference between file subtrees in the transformed 
     AST. Reasons include:
       a) Operations on files would be contaminated.
       b) unparsing of separate files is compromised.
  3) The AST copy mechanism will not work properly when parts of what is being copied is
     spanning multiple files.

To combat these problems we need AST multi-file consistancy tests.
These should:
   1) Enforce the definind and non defining declarations are in the same file.
   2) symbols in the symbol table of a scope in one file do not reference 
      declarations in another file.
   3) 



Need tests:
  1) for defining and non-defining declarations in the same file
  2) declarations and their scopes in the same file
